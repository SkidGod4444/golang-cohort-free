## We started with A tour of Go https://go.dev/tour/list
# Topics Covered : 
1. Packages
- go Programs start running in package `main` . 
2. Imports
- We can import packages as parenthesized, "factored" import statement or write multiple import statements.
3. Exported names
- In Go, a name is exported if it begins with a capital letter, so Go interprets `math.Pi` but not  `math.pi`
4. Functions
- Learn to write functions in Go, with zero, one or multiple parameters. Also, notice `type` comes after the variable name.
5. Functions continued
- Learn how `x int, y int` can also be written as `x, y int`
6. Multiple results
- A function can return any number of results. Practice this using `swap` function which returns two or more strings
7. Named return values
- A `return` statement without arguments returns the named return values. This is known as a "naked" return. Use Naked return statements only in short functions.
