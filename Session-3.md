## We started from the next slide: https://go.dev/tour/basics/8
# Topics Covered : 
1. [Variables](https://go.dev/tour/basics/8)
- In go `var` statement declares a list of variables and we can define the type in the last.
2. [Variables with initializers](https://go.dev/tour/basics/9)
- `var` declaration can include initializers, one per variable. And the type can be omitted.
3. [Short variable declarations](https://go.dev/tour/basics/10)
- Inside a func `:=` short assignment statement can be used in place of a var declaration with implicit type.
4. [Basic types](https://go.dev/tour/basics/11)
- We learnt about all the Go's basic types and The `int`, `uint`, and `uintptr` types are usually 32 bits wide on 32-bit systems and 64 bits wide on 64-bit systems. ***Remember by default it comes with 32 bits and then it gets changed as per your system***.
5. [Zero values](https://go.dev/tour/basics/12)
- In GO variables declared without an explicit initial value are given their zero value.
6. [Type conversions](https://go.dev/tour/basics/13)
- The expression `T(v)` converts the value `v` to the type `T`.
7. [Type inference](https://go.dev/tour/basics/14)
- In GO while declaring the variable's type is inferred from the value on the right hand side.
